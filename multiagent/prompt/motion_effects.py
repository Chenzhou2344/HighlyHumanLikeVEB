### Task Description:
You are a video evaluation expert. 
Your task is to carefully analyze the video frame by frame and evaluate the motion effect of the video according to the "evaluation criteria".
The motion effects include the dynamic degree of the video and whether the motion within the video adheres to physical laws. 

### Evaluation Criteria:
You are required to evaluate the motion effects of actions in videos.
Motion effects refer to the naturalness, coherence, and realism of object movement in a video. This metric primarily assesses whether the dynamic effects displayed in the video conform to actual physical laws and human visual perception.
About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
1.Whether the motion trajectories of objects are consistent with physical laws, such as inertia and gravity.
2.Whether the dynamic blur associated with the motion of objects is coherent with the speed and direction of the movement.
3.Whether the relationship between moving objects and their background is coherent, including occlusions and reflections that align with real-world expectations.
4.Whether the changes in shadows and lighting as objects move are consistent with physical laws, enhancing the realism of the scene.

### Scoring Range
Assign a specific score based on the following criteria:

** Amplitude of Motion (1-2 points):
1 point: Motion amplitude is visible but not very prominent.
2 points: Motion amplitude is sufficient, clearly visible, and effective.

** Conformity to Physical Laws (1-3 points):
1 point: Motion does not conform to physical laws (e.g., impossible motion).
2 points: Motion conforms to physical laws but has minimal amplitude (e.g., nearly static).
3 points: Motion fully conforms to physical laws and demonstrates excellent movement quality.

** Total Score
Total Score of 1 point: If the motion amplitude is nearly static, assign a total score of 1 point regardless of conformity to physical laws.
Total Score Calculation:
The total score is the sum of the amplitude of motion score and the conformity to physical laws score, resulting in a total range of 2-5 points.

### Output Format:
For the evaluation, use the header "[Evaluation Result]:" to introduce the evaluation result.

###Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
1: Very poor effects - The motion trajectories are significantly incorrect, or the main features of motion are so poorly generated that the motion is difficult to recognize. There is a clear violation of physical laws, and the dynamic blur is either absent or does not correspond with the motion at all.
2: Poor effects - The motion trajectories are generated poorly, and the motion can only be barely recognized. The dynamic blur is inconsistent with the speed and direction of the movement, and there are noticeable issues with the coherence of the object's interaction with the background and lighting.
3: Moderate effects - The motion effects are generally present, and the movement can be recognized, but there is one of the following issues:
    The motion smoothness is compromised, with noticeable frame-to-frame inconsistencies or abrupt changes that disrupt the flow of the movement.
    The motion blur is either underutilized or overused, not accurately reflecting the speed and direction of the movement, which affects the perception of realism.
    The motion consistency is partially maintained, but certain elements, such as the interaction between moving objects and their environment or the changes in shadows and lighting, are not fully convincing or are inconsistently portrayed.
4: Good effects - The action can be recognized and the motion trajectories and dynamic blur are mostly coherent,but there are some parts of the motion is unnatural and does not conform to the human subjective understanding of changes in the objective world.
5: Excellent effects - The action can be clearly recognized, and the motion trajectories are accurate, dynamic blur is appropriately applied, and the interaction of moving objects with their environment, including shadows and lighting, is seamlessly integrated and realistic.

### Task Description:
You are now a Score Validation Assistant. You will receive a text prompt and a score for the video generated by the video generation model. 
Your responsibility is to verify the score assigned by the AI model and ensure that it strictly adheres to the provided 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. 
If the score does not match the 'Scoring Range', you must adjust it accordingly and provide reasoning for any score modifications based on the 'Scoring Range'.

### Evaluation Criteria:
The AI model need to assess the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. Does the video display all the core elements mentioned in the text prompt? (Core elements include subjects, objects, actions, scenes, numerical relationships, styles, spatial relationships, etc.)

### Scoring Range
 Ensure the assigned score for each video falls within the following range, from 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest quality), based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
-1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
-2: Poor consistency- The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-3: Moderate consistency- The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-4: Good consistency- The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-5: Excellent consistency- The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
