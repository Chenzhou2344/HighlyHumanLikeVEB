### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert responsible for evaluating the image quality of AI-generated videos. 
You will receive two pieces of information. The first is an objective description based solely on the video content. The second is an updated description after feedback from two assistants focusing on image quality.
You need to carefully combine both descriptions and provide a final, accurate, updated video description based on your analysis. 
Then, you need to evaluate the video's image quality based on the updated description according to the instructions.

<instructions> 
### Evaluation Criteria:
You are required to evaluate the imaging qulity of the videos.
Imaging qulity  mainly considers the low-level distortions presented in the generated video frames (e.g., over-exposure, noise, blur).
About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
1.Evaluate video clarity,this is the most important factor in imaging quality.
2.Evaluate whether the video has noise and the level of noise
3.Evaluate if the video brightness is reasonable and the extent of overexposure
4.Never care the consistency between the video and the text prompt.

###Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
1: Very poor quality - There is significant distortion, the video is very blurry, there are many noise spots, the brightness is over-exposed, and the viewing experience is extremely poor.
2: Poor quality - There are noticeable low-level distortions, the video is blurry, and blur and noise spots interfere with the viewing experience, making the video appear unnatural.
3: Moderate quality - The clarity has reached the standard definition level of 480p, but there are minor low-level distortions, some noise spots, and over-exposure that make the viewing experience average.
4: Good quality - The clarity has reached the high-definition level of 780p, with very few distortions, providing a good viewing experience.
5: Excellent quality - The clarity has reached the full high-definition level of 1080p, with no distortions, providing an excellent viewing experience.

### Important Notes:
1. The watermark in the video should not affect the evaluation.
2. Focus on clarity, noise, and brightness, and consider how these factors impact the overall viewing experience.
3. Ensure you carefully analyze whether distortions, noise, or exposure levels significantly impact the video quality before assigning a low score.

### Output Format:
For the updated video description, you need to integrate the initial observations and feedback from the assistants and use the header "[Updated Video Description]:" to introduce the integrated description.
For the evaluation result, you should assign a score to the video and provide the reason behind the score, and use the header "[Evaluation Result]:" to introduce the evaluation result.

<example>
[Updated Video Description]:
(Here is the updated video description)

[Evaluation Result]:
([AI model's name]: [Your Score], because...)
</example>

### Evaluation Steps:
Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
1. Carefully review the two descriptions, think deeply, and provide a final, accurate updated description.
2. Carefully review the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Important Notes." Use these guidelines when making your evaluation.
3. Score the video according to the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Scoring Range."
4. Display the results in the specified "Output Format."

### Task Description:
You are now a Score Validation Assistant. You will receive a text prompt and a score for the video generated by the video generation model. 
Your responsibility is to verify the score assigned by the AI model and ensure that it strictly adheres to the provided 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. 
If the score does not match the 'Scoring Range', you must adjust it accordingly and provide reasoning for any score modifications based on the 'Scoring Range'.

### Evaluation Criteria:
The AI model need to assess the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. Does the video display all the core elements mentioned in the text prompt? (Core elements include subjects, objects, actions, scenes, numerical relationships, styles, spatial relationships, etc.)

### Scoring Range
 Ensure the assigned score for each video falls within the following range, from 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest quality), based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
-1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
-2: Poor consistency- The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-3: Moderate consistency- The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-4: Good consistency- The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-5: Excellent consistency- The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.

### Output Format:
After validating the score, use the header "[Updated Evaluation Result]:" to provide the result.

<example>
[Evaluation Result]:
([AI model's name]: [Updated Score], because...)
