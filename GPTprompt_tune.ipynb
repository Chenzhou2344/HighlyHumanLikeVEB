      "- Lavie: 1, because the video frames have serious issues in terms of color and composition. The colors are flat and lack variation, making the sunset scene appear dull. The composition is poor, with the sun positioned awkwardly and the beach barely visible. The overall visual appeal and emotional expression are minimal, leading to a poor aesthetic experience.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video frames exhibit excellent color harmony, with a beautiful transition of colors in the sky and reflections on the water. The composition is well-balanced, capturing the sunset, clouds, and beach in a visually appealing manner. The video has a strong emotional resonance and overall harmony.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 4, because the video frames have vibrant and striking colors that create a visually appealing scene. However, the colors may appear slightly exaggerated, which can detract from the natural feel of a sunset. The composition is good, but the overall harmony is slightly less compared to Gen2.\n",
      "- Pika: 4, because the video frames have a dramatic and visually striking color palette, with a good composition that includes the sunset, clouds, and beach. The colors are vibrant and create a strong emotional impact, but the overall harmony is slightly less natural compared to Gen2.\n",
      "- Show1: 3, because the video frames have a more subdued color palette, which can be aesthetically pleasing but lacks the vibrancy and emotional impact of the other videos. The composition is simple and effective, but the overall visual appeal is moderate.\n",
      "- Lavie: 2, because the video frames have a more muted color palette and the composition is less dynamic. The colors and lighting are less striking, and the overall visual appeal and emotional expression are lower compared to the other videos. The frames also appear to have a watermark, which detracts from the aesthetic quality.\n"
