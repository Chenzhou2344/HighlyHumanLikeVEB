      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is accurately applied to the bicycle, and there are no abrupt changes in color.\n",
      "- Pika: 5, because the video consistently shows red bicycles throughout all frames. The color is accurately applied to the bicycles, and there are no abrupt changes in color.\n",
      "- Show1: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is accurately applied to the bicycle, and there are no abrupt changes in color.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is accurately applied to the bicycle, and there are no abrupt changes in color.\n",
      "- Lavie: 4, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the frames are somewhat close-up and the color application is slightly inconsistent in some areas. However, the overall color consistency is good.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is stable and accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Pika: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with no color fluctuations. The red color is correctly applied to the bicycle, and the frames maintain this consistency.\n",
      "- Show1: 4, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the background also has red elements which might slightly distract from the main subject. However, the color consistency on the bicycle itself is good.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with no color jumps or fluctuations. The red color is accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the first frame is abstract and does not clearly depict the bicycle. The subsequent frames are consistent, but the initial frame affects the overall consistency.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is stable and accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Pika: 3, because while the video shows a red bicycle wheel, it only focuses on a part of the bicycle and does not provide a full view of the bicycle. The color is consistent, but the scope is limited.\n",
      "- Show1: 4, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle, but the background color (red bricks) might cause some distraction. The color of the bicycle is stable and accurate.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with stable and accurate color throughout all frames. The background is neutral, which keeps the focus on the bicycle.\n",
      "- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the frames focus on a close-up of the bicycle's wheel and chain area. The color is consistent, but the view is limited and does not show the entire bicycle.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle throughout all frames, with no abrupt changes in color. The green color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Pika: 4, because the video shows a green bicycle consistently, but the background and lighting make the green color appear slightly different in some frames. The color is still correctly applied to the bicycle.\n",
      "- Show1: 3, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the style is more abstract and less realistic. The green color is consistent, but the overall representation of the bicycle is not as accurate.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle with no abrupt changes in color. The green color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Lavie: 2, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the color is overly bright and inconsistent across frames. Additionally, the first frame is completely black, which detracts from the overall consistency.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle throughout all frames, with no abrupt changes in color. The green color is accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Pika: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle with no color fluctuations. The green color is correctly applied to the bicycle, and the video maintains good color consistency with the text prompt.\n",
      "- Show1: 4, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the background is also green, which might cause some confusion. However, the green color on the bicycle is consistent and matches the text prompt.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle with no abrupt color changes. The green color is accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the color appears overly bright and somewhat inconsistent. The green color is applied to the bicycle, but the overall viewing experience is slightly affected by the color intensity.\n",
      "Final Scores:\n",
      "- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle throughout all frames, with no abrupt changes in color. The color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Pika: 4, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the bicycle design is unconventional and includes a basket, which might not be what the prompt intended. However, the color is consistent and correctly applied.\n",
      "- Show1: 3, because the video shows a black silhouette of a bicycle against a green background. While the green color is present, it is not applied to the bicycle itself, which is the main subject of the prompt.\n",
      "- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle with no abrupt changes in color. The color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n",
      "- Lavie: 2, because the video shows green bicycles, but the frames are blurry and the color application is inconsistent. The bicycles are also not clearly defined, leading to a poor viewing experience.\n"
