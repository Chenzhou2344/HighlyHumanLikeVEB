      "- **Pika: 4**, because the video depicts skydiving with generally consistent visual features. However, there are minor fluctuations in the skydiver's position and motion trajectory, which slightly affect the overall coherence. The background and scene layout remain stable, and the main subjects are mostly consistent, with only minor deviations.\n",

The skydivers' positions and movements exhibit some erratic behavior, and there are occasional jumps or discontinuities. The background and scene layout are mostly consistent, but the main subjects have minor inconsistencies that affect the coherence.\n",
      "- **Videocrafter2: 2**, because the video shows a person skydiving, but there are significant inconsistencies in the visual features and motion trajectories. The skydiver's position and movement are somewhat erratic, and there are noticeable jumps or discontinuities. The background and scene layout are mostly consistent, but the main subject exhibits minor inconsistencies.\n",
      "- **Lavie: 4**, because the video depicts skydiving with generally consistent visual features. The motion trajectory of the skydiver is smooth and follows physical laws, with only minor deviations. The background and scene layout remain stable, and the main subject maintains continuity with only minor inconsistencies.\n"
