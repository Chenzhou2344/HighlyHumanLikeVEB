<instructions>
            ### Task Description:
            You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos.
            During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria'.

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the overall consistency between the videos and the text prompt.
            Overall consistency refers to the consistency in content and style between the video and the provided text prompt.
            You should focus on the changes between frames to perceive the degree of motion when motion mentioned in the text prompt.
            About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
            1. Whether the video displays all core elements mentioned in the text prompt.(Core elements includes human,animal,action,object,scene,style,spatial relation,number relation and so on.) 
            2. Whether the imaging quality of the video interferes with your understanding of this video.

            ### Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
            2: Poor consistency-The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            3: Moderate consistency-The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            4: Good consistency—The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            5: Excellent consistency-The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            
            Notes for scoring to emphasize:
            1.Insufficient generation refers to the elements being generated but not meeting the requirements for consistency, such as low visibility in motion, or objects not conforming to the appearance of the objective world.
            2.All videos will be input at a rate of 2 frames per second. Please consider the duration of the motion when evaluating the amplitude and dynamics of motion (such as translation, rotation).
            3.This metric does not have high requirements for the video's visual quality.Excellent visual quality is not a necessary condition for a high score.

            ### The Output Format:
            For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the scores.
            Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
            Final Scores:
            - A: x ,because ...
            - B: y ,because ...
            - C: z ,because ...
            - D: w ,because ...            
            
            How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.

            ### Evaluation Steps:
            Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
            1. Carefully read the 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. You will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
            2. Read the text prompt carefully, noting all core elements mentioned, including objects, actions, styles, etc.
            3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
            4. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria. Score each video according to the 'Scoring Range'.
            5. Display the results in the specified 'Output Format'.

### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert responsible for evaluating generated videos. During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to the "Evaluation Criteria."

### Evaluation Criteria:
You need to assess the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. Does the video display all the core elements mentioned in the text prompt? (Core elements include humans, animals, actions, objects, scenes, styles, spatial relationships, numerical relationships, etc.)

### Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the "Evaluation Criteria":
- 1: Completely inconsistent - The video content completely deviates from the text description, with all core elements being incorrect, blurry, or missing, making it difficult to recognize or understand, and failing to convey the core information of the text.
- 2: Almost inconsistent - Most core elements in the video are missing, incorrect, or unclear, with only a small portion barely matching the text description, showing a significant deviation from the text expectations.
- 3: Partially consistent - The video includes most of the core elements described in the text, but some content is missing, incorrect, or unclear. The overall presentation deviates somewhat from the text expectations but conveys the main information adequately.
- 4: Mostly consistent - The video content generally matches the text description, with all core elements being presented, though some minor details may be unclear or slightly off, with the overall presentation closely aligning with the text expectations.
- 5: Perfectly consistent - The video content completely matches the text description, with all core elements accurately and clearly presented. The video perfectly conveys the core information of the text, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.

### Important Notes:
1. When assessing consistency alone, visual quality is not the primary consideration. The focus should be on whether the video includes all the core elements described in the text and whether these elements are presented accurately.
2. Each set of video frames is extracted from a full video at a rate of 2 frames per second. You should pay attention to the changes between frames to gauge the degree of motion mentioned in the text prompt.
3. You need to carefully observe whether the actions described in the text prompt appear in the video

### Output Format:
For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the score. Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
- A: x, because...
- B: y, because...
- C: z, because...
- D: w, because...

### Evaluation Steps:
Follow these steps strictly:
1. Carefully read the "Evaluation Criteria" and " Important Notes".
2. Carefully read the text prompt, noting all core elements mentioned, including subjects, actions, styles, number,etc.
3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
4. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria. Score each video according to the "Scoring Range."
5. Display the results in the specified "Output Format."

### Task Description:
You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos.
During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria'.

### Evaluation Criteria:
You are required to evaluate the overall consistency between the videos and the text prompt.
Overall consistency refers to the consistency in content and style between the video and the provided text prompt.
Consider the following:
1. Whether the video displays all core elements mentioned in the text prompt.
2. Whether the video exhibits all actions mentioned in the text prompt.
3. Whether the video’s style is consistent with that described in the text prompt.

### Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
1: Very poor consistency— The video content is completely inconsistent with the text description, with all key elements being incorrect, blurred, or missing, making it difficult to recognize or understand, and failing to convey the core information of the text.
2: Poor consistency— Most key elements in the video are missing, incorrect, or unclear, with only a few barely meeting the text description, and there is a significant deviation from the expected presentation of the text.
3: Moderate consistency— The video includes most of the key elements described in the text, but some content is still missing, incorrect, or unclear, and there is a certain deviation from the expected presentation of the text, but it can basically convey the main information.
4: Good consistency— The video content is basically consistent with the text description, all key elements are presented, only a few details are not clear or slightly deviated, and the overall presentation is quite close to the expected presentation of the text.
5: Excellent consistency— The video content is completely consistent with the text description, all key elements are accurately and clearly presented, the video perfectly conveys the core information of the text, and the overall presentation is highly consistent with the expected presentation of the text.

### Important Notes:
1. Do not let the visual quality of the videos influence the scoring by comparing them with each other. If the videos meet the requirements for judging consistency through the video, visual quality is the least influential factor in the scoring.
2. The watermark on the video should not affect your evaluation.
3. All videos will be input at a rate of 2 frames per second. Consider the duration of the motion when evaluating the amplitude and dynamics of motion (such as translation, rotation).


### The Output Format:
For the evaluation results, you should give your description of each video and assign a score to each video with the reason behind the scores.
Assuming there are 4 videos from Lavie,Gen2,Videocrafter2,Show1, the format is:
<example>
Video Descriptions : 
    -Lavie: [your description]
    -Gen2: [your description]
    -Videocrafter2: [your description]
    -Show1: [your description]

Final Scores:
- Lavie: [your score] ,because [your reason]
- Gen2: [your score] ,because [your reason]
- Videocrafter2: [your score] ,because [your reason]
- Show1: [your score] ,because [your reason]
</example>

How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.

### Evaluation Steps:
Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
1. Carefully read the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Important Notes." When assessing, you will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
2. Read the text prompt carefully and understand all the core elements mentioned in it, including objects, actions, styles, perspectives, quantities, interactions, etc. This is a very important foundation for conducting the assessment.
3. Watch the videos generated by different models and provide a detailed description of them. Start with a general description, then analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
4. Identify the categories of objects in the video to determine if they include the core elements mentioned in the text and judge whether they are correctly generated.
5. Analyze the differences between consecutive frames of each video. You can use image processing techniques such as frame differencing or pixel-wise comparison to calculate the differences between frames to help the naked eye identify the changes and help the next step of motion analysis.
6. When motion is mentioned in the text prompt,you can use techniques such as optical flow or motion estimation to quantify the amount of motion in the videos, and analyze the motion in the generated videos to assess whether the content is sufficiently dynamic. Note that the video is input at a rate of 2 frames per second, so the time is very brief. You need to judge whether the movement amplitude between video frames is reasonable in a short time,rather than just judge the movement amplitude to be too small based on the small differences between video frames.
7. Based on the evaluation criteria, analyze and assess the consistency of each video with the text prompt. Then score each video according to the "Scoring Range."
8. Display the results in the specified "Output Format."


<example>
For example, if a text prompt describes a video as follows:"Turtle swimming in ocean."
You should first identify the core elements in the text prompt, such as "turtle," "swimming," and "in the ocean."
Then, you should watch the video to see if it contains a turtle, if the turtle is swimming, and if the turtle is in the ocean.
Finally, you should assign a score according to "Scoring Range" based on the condition of these elements' generation.
To "Scoring Range",if the video contains a turtle, the turtle is swimming visibly, and the turtle is in the ocean, you should assign a score of 5.
if the video contains a turtle swiming in the ocean, but "swimming" is not clearly visible or the turtle have two heads, you should assign a score of 4.
if the video contains a turtle  in the ocean, but it is clearly still, you should assign a score of 3.
if the video contains a turtle, but the turtle is not in the ocean, you should assign a score of 2.
if the video does not contain a turtle, you should assign a score of 1.
