<instructions>
            ### Task Description:
            You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos.
            During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria'.

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the overall consistency between the videos and the text prompt.
            Overall consistency refers to the consistency in content and style between the video and the provided text prompt.
            You should focus on the changes between frames to perceive the degree of motion when motion mentioned in the text prompt.
            About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
            1. Whether the video displays all core elements mentioned in the text prompt.(Core elements includes human,animal,action,object,scene,style,spatial relation,number relation and so on.) 
            2. Whether the imaging quality of the video interferes with your understanding of this video.

            ### Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
            2: Poor consistency-The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            3: Moderate consistency-The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            4: Good consistencyâ€”The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            5: Excellent consistency-The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            
            Notes for scoring to emphasize:
            1.Insufficient generation refers to the elements being generated but not meeting the requirements for consistency, such as low visibility in motion, or objects not conforming to the appearance of the objective world.
            2.All videos will be input at a rate of 2 frames per second. Please consider the duration of the motion when evaluating the amplitude and dynamics of motion (such as translation, rotation).
            3.This metric does not have high requirements for the video's visual quality.Excellent visual quality is not a necessary condition for a high score.

            ### The Output Format:
            For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the scores.
            Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
            Final Scores:
            - A: x ,because ...
            - B: y ,because ...
            - C: z ,because ...
            - D: w ,because ...            
            
            How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.

            ### Evaluation Steps:
            Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
            1. Carefully read the 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. You will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
            2. Read the text prompt carefully, noting all core elements mentioned, including objects, actions, styles, etc.
            3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
            4. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria. Score each video according to the 'Scoring Range'.
            5. Display the results in the specified 'Output Format'.

            You shouldn't take any video from any model in input as a reference for the evaluation.Please evaluate the video independently based on 'Evaluation Criteria'.

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the color consistency between the videos and the text prompt.
            Color consistency refers to the consistency in color between the video and the provided text prompt.
            About how to evaluate this metric,after you watching the frames of videos,you should first consider the following:
            1. Whether the color is consistent with the text prompt and remain consistent throughout the entire video and there are no abrupt changes in color.
            2. Whether the color is on the right object or scene.
            3. Whether the appearance of the subject significantly differs from objective reality,in other words,whether the structure of the object is reasonable and pleasing or causes psychological discomfort.

            ###Important Notes:
            And you should also pay attention to the following notes:
            1.The watermark in the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.
            2.The style of the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.
            3.Whether the main subject is the primary focus or not doesn't matter,if the relationship between the main subject and the other objects is reasonable,

            Then based on the above considerations, you need to assign a specific score from 1 to 3 for each video(from 1 to 3, with 3 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) according to the 'Scoring Range':
            
            1. Poor consistency - The generated object is incorrect or the color on the object does not match the text prompt at all.
            2. Moderate consistency - The correct color appears in the video, but it's not perfect. The specific conditions are:
                - Condition 1 : Incorrect color allocation, such as the color appearing in the background instead of on the object.
                - Condition 2 : Color instability, with sudden or fluctuating changes in the color on the object.
                - Condition 3 : Color confusion, where part of the object has the correct color but is mixed with other colors, and the other colors occupy a large area (at first glance, the required color is not the main color). For example: a white vase is generated as a black and white striped vase.
                - Condition 4 : The object's color blends into the background color, making it difficult to distinguish.
                - Condition 5 : The object's color is in the same color spectrum as the requested color but not very accurate. For example, pink instead of purple, or yellow instead of orange.
            3.  Good consistency  - The color is highly consistent with the text prompt, the color in the entire video is stable, the color distribution is correct, there are no sudden changes or inconsistencies in color, and there are no issues mentioned in the moderate consistency category.

            
            ### The Output Format:

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the motion effects of actions in videos.
            Motion effects refer to the naturalness, coherence, and realism of object movement in a video. This metric primarily assesses whether the dynamic effects displayed in the video conform to actual physical laws and human visual perception.
            About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
                1.Whether the motion trajectories of objects are consistent with physical laws, such as inertia and gravity.
                2.Whether the dynamic blur associated with the motion of objects is coherent with the speed and direction of the movement.
                3.Whether the relationship between moving objects and their background is coherent, including occlusions and reflections that align with real-world expectations.
                4.Whether the changes in shadows and lighting as objects move are consistent with physical laws, enhancing the realism of the scene.

            ###Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor effects - The motion trajectories are significantly incorrect, or the main features of motion are so poorly generated that the motion is difficult to recognize. There is a clear violation of physical laws, and the dynamic blur is either absent or does not correspond with the motion at all.
            2: Poor effects - The motion trajectories are generated poorly, and the motion can only be barely recognized. The dynamic blur is inconsistent with the speed and direction of the movement, and there are noticeable issues with the coherence of the object's interaction with the background and lighting.
            3: Moderate effects - The motion effects are generally present, and the movement can be recognized, but there is one of the following issues:
                The motion smoothness is compromised, with noticeable frame-to-frame inconsistencies or abrupt changes that disrupt the flow of the movement.
                The motion blur is either underutilized or overused, not accurately reflecting the speed and direction of the movement, which affects the perception of realism.
                The motion consistency is partially maintained, but certain elements, such as the interaction between moving objects and their environment or the changes in shadows and lighting, are not fully convincing or are inconsistently portrayed.
            4: Good effects - The action can be recognized and the motion trajectories and dynamic blur are mostly coherent,but there are some parts of the motion is unnatural and does not conform to the human subjective understanding of changes in the objective world.
            5: Excellent effects - The action can be clearly recognized, and the motion trajectories are accurate, dynamic blur is appropriately applied, and the interaction of moving objects with their environment, including shadows and lighting, is seamlessly integrated and realistic.
           
            Note: The evaluation of motion effects does not need to care the action consistency too much. The focus is on whether the motion effects of actions in the video conform to actual physical laws and human visual perception.

             ### The Output Format:
            For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the scores.
            Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
            Final Scores:
            - A: x ,because ...
            - B: y ,because ...
            - C: z ,because ...
            - D: w ,because ...            
            
            How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.

            ### Evaluation Steps:
            Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
            1. Carefully read the 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. You will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
            2. Read the text prompt carefully,noting the scene mentioned in the text prompt.
            3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
            4. Compare the differences between consecutive frames to understand the action process in the video.
            5. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria and think about the questions below step by step and then Score each video according to the 'Scoring Range':
                Whether the motion trajectories of objects are consistent with physical laws, such as inertia and gravity.
                Whether the dynamic blur associated with the motion of objects is coherent with the speed and direction of the movement.
                Whether the relationship between moving objects and their background is coherent, including occlusions and reflections that align with real-world expectations.
                Whether the changes in shadows and lighting as objects move are consistent with physical laws, enhancing the realism of the scene.

            ### Task Description:
            You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos.
            During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria'.

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the temporal coherence of videos.
            Temporal coherence refers to the continuity and stability of visual and semantic features across consecutive frames in a video or animation sequence.
            About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
                1.Whether the visual features such as color, brightness, texture, and details maintain smooth transitions between consecutive frames.
                2.Whether the motion trajectories of objects follow physical laws and exhibit smooth movement without abrupt jumps or discontinuities.
                3.Whether the semantic features such as object positions, shapes, scene layout, and background remain consistent across frames.
                4.Whether the main subjects in the video maintain continuity and do not exhibit sudden or unnatural changes.          

            ###Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor coherence - There are significant inconsistencies in color, brightness, and texture between frames, with noticeable flickering or sudden changes. Object motion trajectories are erratic and do not follow physical laws. Semantic features like object positions and scene layout are inconsistent, and main subjects exhibit sudden or unnatural changes.
            2: Poor coherence - There are noticeable inconsistencies in visual features, and object motion trajectories are somewhat erratic. Semantic features are mostly consistent, but there are occasional issues with object positions and scene layout. Main subjects may have minor inconsistencies.
            3: Moderate coherence - Visual features are generally consistent, with only minor fluctuations in color, brightness, and texture. Object motion trajectories are mostly smooth, but there may be occasional jumps or discontinuities. Semantic features are mostly consistent, with only minor issues affecting the coherence of object positions, shapes, and scene layout. Main subjects are generally consistent, with only minor deviations.
            4: Good coherence - Visual features are consistently maintained across frames, with smooth transitions in color, brightness, and texture. Object motion trajectories are smooth and follow physical laws, with only minor deviations. Semantic features are coherent, with object positions, shapes, and scene layout remaining stable. Main subjects are consistent, with only minor inconsistencies that do not significantly affect the overall coherence.
            5: Excellent coherence -  All visual features are seamlessly consistent across frames, with no perceptible flickering or sudden changes. Object motion trajectories are perfectly smooth and adhere to physical laws. Semantic features are fully consistent, with object positions, shapes, scene layout, and background remaining unchanged. Main subjects are entirely consistent, with no noticeable deviations that would affect the viewer's perception of continuity.

            ### The Output Format:
            For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the scores.
            Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
            Final Scores:
            - A: x ,because ...
            - B: y ,because ...
            - C: z ,because ...
            - D: w ,because ...            
            
            How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.
