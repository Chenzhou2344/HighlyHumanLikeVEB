            ### Task Description:
            You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos.
            During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria'.

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the overall consistency between the videos and the text prompt.
            Overall consistency refers to the consistency in content and style between the video and the provided text prompt.
            You should focus on the changes between frames to perceive the degree of motion when motion mentioned in the text prompt.
            About how to evaluate this metric,onsider the following:
            1. Whether the video displays all core elements mentioned in the text prompt.(Core elements includes human,animal,action,object,scene,style,spatial relation,number relation and so on.) 
            2. Whether the imaging quality of the video interferes with your understanding of this video.

            ### Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
            2: Poor consistency-The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            3: Moderate consistency-The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            4: Good consistency—The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            5: Excellent consistency-The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
            
            Notes for scoring to emphasize:
            1.Insufficient generation refers to the elements being generated but not meeting the requirements for consistency, such as low visibility in motion, or objects not conforming to the appearance of the objective world.
            2.All videos will be input at a rate of 2 frames per second. Please consider the duration of the motion when evaluating the amplitude and dynamics of motion (such as translation, rotation).
            3.This metric does not have high requirements for the video's visual quality.Excellent visual quality is not a necessary condition for a high score.

            ### The Output Format:
            For the evaluation results, you should assign a score to each video and provide the reason behind the scores.
            Assuming there are 4 videos input, the format is:
            Final Scores:
            - A: x ,because ...
            - B: y ,because ...
            - C: z ,because ...
            - D: w ,because ...            
            
            How many score lines in this format is up to how many videos input.

            ### Evaluation Steps:
            Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
            1. Carefully read the 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. You will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
            2. Read the text prompt carefully, noting all core elements mentioned, including objects, actions, styles, etc.
            3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
            4. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria. Score each video according to the 'Scoring Range'.
            5. Display the results in the specified 'Output Format'.

                -Condition 2: Instability (e.g., sudden color changes).
                -Condition 3: Confusion (e.g., part of the object has the right color, but it's not dominant).
                -Condition 4: Blending (e.g., object color merging with the background).
                -Condition 5: Similarity (e.g., pink instead of purple).
            3.  Good consistency  - The color is highly consistent with the text prompt, the color in the entire video is stable, the color distribution is correct, there are no sudden changes or inconsistencies in color, and there are no issues mentioned in the moderate consistency category.

            ### The Output Format:

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You are required to evaluate the object class consistency between the video and the text prompt. Don't think about quantity consistency.
            Object class consistency refers to the consistency in object between the video and the provided text prompt.
            About how to evaluate this metric,after you watching the frames of videos,you should first consider the following:
            1.Whether the objects mentioned in the text were correctly and clearly generated.
            2.Whether the video focuses on only a part of the object.
            3.Whether the appearance and structure of the generated objects conform to objective reality and human subjective cognition.

            
            ###Important Notes:

            1. Poor consistency (score=1)- Completely unrecognizable as the specified object.The object is not discernible at all.
            2. Moderate consistency (score=2)- The object can barely be recognized or is generated imperfectly.The specific conditions are:
                - Condition 1 : A similar object with a related function or structure is generated, (e.g., a "snowboard" instead of "skis", a “unicycle” instead of a “bicycle,”)
                - Condition 2 : The object cannot be accurately recognized, (e.g. Uncertain words such as "appears to, seemingly" appear in the video description).
                - Condition 3 : The object in the video is blurred and inconspicuous, making it difficult to recognize.
                - Condition 4 : The video focuses on only a part of the object. (e.g. generating a human hand instead of a whole person.)
                - Condition 5 : More than 3 frames in the video are missing the object.
                - Condition 6 : The appearance of the object changes significantly. (e.g., a person sometimes has facial features and sometimes does not.)
            3. Good consistency (score=3)- The object category is consistently correct throughout the video, the object is complete, clear, obvious, and remains visible in the video and there are no issues mentioned in the moderate consistency category.

        Each video should be assessed independently, without comparisons to others.

        ### Evaluation Criteria:
        You will assess the scene consistency between each video and the corresponding text prompt.
        Scene consistency involves:
        1. **Recognizability**: Can the scene described in the text be identified in the video?  
        2. **Realism**: Do the elements within the scene align with objective reality and human cognitive understanding?

        ### Important Notes:
        1. Watermarks in the video should not negatively impact your evaluation.  
        2. Acceptable video quality includes some blur or distortion as long as scene recognition is not compromised.  
        3. The style of the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.

        ### Scoring Range:
        1. **Poor Consistency (score=1)**: The scene is unrecognizable and disconnected from the text, making identification difficult.  
        2. **Moderate Consistency (score=2)**: The scene is recognizable but has issues, such as:
        - Showing only a part of the scene(e.g.,a bathroom showing only a sink and mirror).
        - Presenting a too broad view (e.g., generating a hospital building instead of the interior of a hospital).
        - Highlighting only specific features in close-up (e.g., a bakery showing only bread;a laboratory showing tubes).
        - Similarity to the scene but lacking complete accuracy.  
        3. **Good Consistency (score=3)**: The scene is clearly identifiable and matches human understanding of the objective world.
       
        ### Output Format:

                3.Whether the relationship between moving objects and their background is coherent, including occlusions and reflections that align with real-world expectations.
                4.Whether the changes in shadows and lighting as objects move are consistent with physical laws, enhancing the realism of the scene.
        
            ### Important Notes:
            1.The evaluation of motion effects does not need to care the action consistency too much. The focus is on whether the motion effects of actions in the video conform to actual physical laws and human visual perception.
            2.Image quality is not the focus of this evaluation. You should focus on the motion effects of the objects in the video.

            ###Scoring Range
            You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality, using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
            1: Very poor effects - The motion trajectories are significantly incorrect, or the main features of motion are so poorly generated that the motion is difficult to recognize. There is a clear violation of physical laws, and the dynamic blur is either absent or does not correspond with the motion at all.
            2: Poor effects - The motion trajectories are generated poorly, and the motion is barely dynamic. The dynamic blur is inconsistent with the speed and direction of the movement, and there are noticeable issues with the coherence of the object's interaction with the background and lighting.
            3: Moderate effects - The motion effects are generally present, and the movement can be recognized, but there is one of the following issues:
                The motion smoothness is compromised, with noticeable frame-to-frame inconsistencies or abrupt changes that disrupt the flow of the movement.
                The motion blur is either underutilized or overused, not accurately reflecting the speed and direction of the movement, which affects the perception of realism.
                The motion consistency is partially maintained, but certain elements, such as the interaction between moving objects and their environment or the changes in shadows and lighting, are not fully convincing or are inconsistently portrayed.
                The motion is not dynamic enough, lacking the sense of speed and direction that would enhance the realism of the scene.
            4: Good effects - The action can be recognized and the motion trajectories and dynamic blur are mostly coherent,but there are some parts of the motion is unnatural and does not conform to the human subjective understanding of changes in the objective world.
            5: Excellent effects - The action can be clearly recognized, and the motion trajectories are accurate, dynamic blur is appropriately applied, and the interaction of moving objects with their environment, including shadows and lighting, is seamlessly integrated and realistic.
           
            ### Evaluation Steps:
            Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
            1. Carefully read the 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. You will need to review the text prompt and watch the videos with these criteria in mind.
            2. Read the text prompt carefully,noting the scene mentioned in the text prompt.
            3. Watch the frames of videos generated by different models and analyze them in conjunction with the evaluation criteria and text prompt.
            4. Compare the differences between consecutive frames to understand the action process in the video.
            5. Analyze and evaluate the consistency of each video with the text prompt based on the evaluation criteria and think about the questions below step by step and then Score each video according to the 'Scoring Range':
                Whether the motion trajectories of objects are consistent with physical laws, such as inertia and gravity.
                Whether the dynamic blur associated with the motion of objects is coherent with the speed and direction of the movement.
                Whether the relationship between moving objects and their background is coherent, including occlusions and reflections that align with real-world expectations.
                Whether the changes in shadows and lighting as objects move are consistent with physical laws, enhancing the realism of the scene.
            6. Display the results in the specified 'Output Format'.

            ### Task Description:
            You are now an Video Evaluation Expert in evaluating generated videos and have super power to perceive the changes between frames.
            During the evaluation, you must strictly adhere to 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Evaluation Steps'..

            ### Evaluation Criteria:
            You will evaluate the temporal consistency between the video and the text prompt. 
            Temporal consistency is to measure **frame-to-frame** coherence in the video, focusing on the smoothness and stability of visual and semantic features across consecutive frames.
            The visual features includes color, brightness, texture and details.
            The semantic features  includes object class,positions, shapes, and scene layout.
            To evaluate this metric, you should focus on the following aspects:
                1.whether the frame flickering in the video is noticeable.
                2.Whether the 2 kinds of features of the primary object changes unnaturally between consecutive frames.
                3.Whether the 2 kinds of features of the unimportant objects or background changes unnaturally between consecutive frames.
                
            ###Important Notes:
            And you should also pay attention to the following notes:
            1.The watermark in the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.
            2.The style of the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.            

            ### Scoring Range
            Then based on the above considerations, you need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) according to the 'Scoring Range':
            1: Very poor consistency - The video content can be understood, but there are noticeable unnatural changes in the primary object in the video, significantly affecting the overall temporal consistency. 
            2: Poor consistency - The video content can be understood, but there are noticeable inconsistencies or unnatural changes in unimportant objects, which affect the overall coherence.
            3: Moderate consistency - The video content is fully presented but there are noticeable inconsistencies or unnatural changes in background which slightly affect the overall coherence.
            4: Good consistency - The video is complete and comprehensive without noticeable unnatural changes but there are texture flickering or color jitter in the visual features of background.
            5: Excellent consistency -  The video provides a full expression of the content and all visual and semantic features are consistent between consecutive frames, and there are no noticeable frame flickering in the video.
