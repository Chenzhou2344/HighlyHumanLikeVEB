    "1": "Final Scores:\n- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is stable and accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n- Pika: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with no color fluctuations. The red color is correctly applied to the bicycle, and the frames maintain this consistency.\n- Show1: 4, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the background also has red elements which might slightly distract from the main subject. However, the color consistency on the bicycle itself is good.\n- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with no color jumps or fluctuations. The red color is accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the first frame is abstract and does not clearly depict the bicycle. The subsequent frames are consistent, but the initial frame affects the overall consistency.",
    "2": "Final Scores:\n- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle throughout all frames. The color is stable and accurately applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n- Pika: 3, because while the video shows a red bicycle wheel, it only focuses on a part of the bicycle and does not provide a full view of the bicycle. The color is consistent, but the scope is limited.\n- Show1: 4, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle, but the background color (red bricks) might cause some distraction. The color of the bicycle is stable and accurate.\n- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a red bicycle with stable and accurate color throughout all frames. The background is neutral, which keeps the focus on the bicycle.\n- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a red bicycle, but the frames focus on a close-up of the bicycle's wheel and chain area. The color is consistent, but the view is limited and does not show the entire bicycle.",
    "3": "Final Scores:\n- Gen2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle throughout all frames, with no abrupt changes in color. The green color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n- Pika: 4, because the video shows a green bicycle consistently, but the background and lighting make the green color appear slightly different in some frames. The color is still correctly applied to the bicycle.\n- Show1: 3, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the style is more abstract and less realistic. The green color is consistent, but the overall representation of the bicycle is not as accurate.\n- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video consistently shows a green bicycle with no abrupt changes in color. The green color is correctly applied to the bicycle, matching the text prompt perfectly.\n- Lavie: 2, because the video shows a green bicycle, but the color is overly bright and inconsistent across frames. Additionally, the first frame is completely black, which detracts from the overall consistency.",
