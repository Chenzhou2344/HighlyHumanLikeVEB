        "kling": "- Video: 2, because the motion amplitude is visible but not very prominent, scoring 1 point. The motion conforms to physical laws, but the movement is minimal, scoring 1 point. Therefore, the total score is 2 points.",
        "gen3": "- Video: 3, because the motion amplitude is visible but not very prominent, earning 1 point. The motion conforms to physical laws, with smooth transitions and realistic movement, earning 2 points. The total score is 3 points.",
        "videocrafter2": "- Video: 2, because the motion amplitude is visible but not very prominent, earning 1 point. The motion appears nearly static, which results in a total score of 1 point regardless of conformity to physical laws.",
