        "lavie": "- video: 3, because the motion effects are moderate. The typing action is recognizable, but there are issues with motion smoothness and dynamic blur. The hand movements appear somewhat abrupt and lack fluidity, which disrupts the natural flow. The dynamic blur is not consistently applied, affecting the perception of speed and direction. The interaction between the hands and the keyboard is not fully convincing, and there are inconsistencies in lighting and shadows that reduce realism."

The motion trajectories appear somewhat rigid, lacking natural fluidity. The dynamic blur is minimal, which affects the perception of speed and realism. The interaction between the hand and the background is mostly coherent, but the lighting and shadows do not change significantly, reducing the overall realism.",
        "kling": "- video: 3, because the motion of the hand interacting with the flowers is somewhat recognizable, but there are issues with the smoothness and realism of the movement. The hand's motion trajectory appears slightly unnatural, lacking fluidity and consistent speed. The dynamic blur is minimal, which affects the perception of motion. Additionally, the interaction between the hand and the flowers does not fully align with real-world expectations, as there is a lack of visible impact or change in the flowers' position or shape. Shadows and lighting changes are not evident, reducing the overall realism of the scene.",
        "gen3": "- video: 2, because the motion effects in the video are poor. The movement of the bouquet and hands lacks smoothness and coherence. The motion trajectories appear inconsistent with physical laws, such as inertia and gravity. There is a noticeable absence of dynamic blur, which should correspond with the speed and direction of the movement. Additionally, the interaction between the moving objects and the background is not coherent, with lighting and shadows not aligning with real-world expectations. These issues result in a lack of realism and disrupt the perception of natural motion.",
        "videocrafter2": "- video: 2, because the motion effects in the video are poor. The motion trajectories of the person and the bouquet are not consistent with physical laws, as there is little to no visible movement between frames. The dynamic blur is absent, which makes the motion appear static and unrealistic. The interaction between the moving objects and the background lacks coherence, and there are no noticeable changes in shadows or lighting to enhance realism. Overall, the video fails to convey a sense of natural movement.",
        "pika": "- video: 1, because the motion effects are very poor. The key frames show no noticeable change or movement in the bouquet or the hands holding it. The motion trajectories are not consistent with physical laws, as there is no visible motion or dynamic blur. The interaction between the objects and the background remains static, with no changes in shadows or lighting, making the scene unrealistic and lacking any sense of motion.",
        "show1": "- video: 2, because the motion effects in the video are poor. The motion trajectories of the hand and flowers are not smooth, with noticeable inconsistencies between frames. The dynamic blur is either absent or not coherent with the speed and direction of the movement, making the motion appear unnatural. Additionally, the interaction between the moving hand and the background lacks coherence, and there are no visible changes in shadows or lighting that would enhance realism. Overall, the video fails to convincingly portray realistic motion according to physical laws and human visual perception.",
