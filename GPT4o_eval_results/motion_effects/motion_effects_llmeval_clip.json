If the video clip has unnatural motion, consider the following points for evaluation:\n- **Motion Trajectories**: Check if the motion paths of objects follow physical laws like gravity and inertia. Unnatural motion might include abrupt changes in direction or speed that don't align with these laws.\n- **Dynamic Blur**: Evaluate if the blur corresponds with the speed and direction of movement. Unnatural motion might have inconsistent or absent blur effects.\n- **Interaction with Background**: Look for coherence between moving objects and their background, including occlusions and reflections. Unnatural motion might show objects not interacting realistically with their environment.\n- **Shadows and Lighting**: Assess if changes in shadows and lighting are consistent with the movement. Unnatural motion might have shadows that don't align with the light source or movement.\nBased on these criteria, if the video clip has noticeable unnatural motion, it might score lower. For example:\n- **Video Clip: 2**, because the motion trajectories are poorly generated, with abrupt changes that violate physical laws. The dynamic blur is inconsistent, and the interaction with the background lacks coherence, leading to an overall unrealistic appearance.",
