    "246": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 3, because the video shows a robot in a city setting, but there is minimal motion and no clear indication of the robot actively protecting the city. The visual quality is good, but the action element is lacking.\n- Pika: 4, because the video includes multiple robots and a cityscape, with some dynamic motion suggesting protection. The setting and style are consistent with the prompt, but the protective action could be more explicit.\n- Show1: 2, because the video focuses on a static robot with minimal motion and no clear city context. The lack of dynamic action and city elements makes it less consistent with the prompt.\n- Lavie: 4, because the video features a large robot in a city environment with some motion, suggesting a protective stance. The visual style and elements align well with the prompt, though the protective action could be more pronounced.",
    "249": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 2, because the video shows teddy bears in a sink, but they are not washing dishes. The core action of washing is missing, and the bears appear to be sitting in water instead.\n- Pika: 5, because the video clearly shows a teddy bear in a sink with dishes, actively involved in washing. The action and setting are consistent with the prompt, and the visual quality is good.\n- Show1: 3, because the video includes a teddy bear near a sink with running water, but the action of washing dishes is not clearly depicted. The bear's interaction with the dishes is minimal.\n- Lavie: 4, because the video shows a teddy bear at a sink with running water, appearing to wash something, but the presence of dishes is not clear. The action is somewhat consistent with the prompt.",
    "252": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video captures the epic tornado made of smoke above a glowing city at night. The tornado is well-defined, and the lighting effects enhance the dramatic scene, maintaining excellent consistency with the prompt.\n- Pika: 2, because while there is a glowing effect, the video lacks a clear depiction of a tornado or a city. The elements do not sufficiently represent the prompt, and the consistency is poor.\n- Show1: 3, because the video shows a tornado-like structure, but the city and glowing effects are not prominent. The tornado is somewhat visible, but the overall scene lacks the epic and dramatic quality described in the prompt.\n- Lavie: 4, because the video shows a tornado above a city at night, with some glowing effects. However, the tornado lacks the dramatic smoke appearance, and the overall scene could be more dynamic to fully match the prompt.",
    "255": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 5, because the video captures all core elements of the prompt, including the couple in formal evening wear, umbrellas, and a heavy downpour. The oil painting style is consistent, and the visual quality is excellent.\n- Pika: 4, because the video includes the couple, umbrellas, and rain, but the style is more impressionistic than oil painting. The scene is consistent with the prompt, but the details are less defined.\n- Show1: 3, because the video shows a couple with umbrellas in the rain, but the style is more realistic and lacks the oil painting effect. The visual quality is good, but the formal wear is not clearly depicted.\n- Lavie: 2, because the video shows a couple in formal wear with an umbrella, but the rain is not as prominent, and the style does not resemble an oil painting. The visual quality is moderate, but the consistency with the prompt is weak.",
    "258": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 4, because the video includes the clown fish and coral reef, with good visual quality. However, the motion of the fish is limited, and the scene lacks variety in the coral reef.\n- Pika: 5, because the video shows multiple clown fish swimming actively through a detailed coral reef. The motion and interaction with the environment are well-represented, and the visual quality is high.\n- Show1: 3, because the video includes a clown fish and coral reef, but the motion is minimal, and the visual quality is lower, making it harder to appreciate the details.\n- Lavie: 4, because the video features a clown fish and coral reef with good visual quality. The fish's motion is present, but the scene lacks diversity in the coral reef elements.",
    "261": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 4, because the video shows a spaceship on a Martian landscape with good detail and realism. However, the motion of landing is not very evident, as the frames show minimal change.\n- Pika: 5, because the video effectively captures the spaceship landing on Mars with clear motion and hyper-realistic details. The lighting and environment enhance the realism, aligning well with the prompt.\n- Show1: 3, because the video includes a spaceship and a Martian landscape, but the realism is moderate, and the landing motion is not very dynamic or clear.\n- Lavie: 2, because the video lacks a clear depiction of a spaceship landing. The frames show minimal change, and the realism is insufficient to meet the prompt's requirements.",
    "264": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 3, because the video captures the Bund in Shanghai with vibrant colors, but the motion is minimal, and the vibrancy could be more pronounced.\n- Pika: 5, because the video excellently captures the vibrant colors and iconic skyline of the Bund at night, with good motion and consistency with the prompt.\n- Show1: 4, because the video shows the Bund with vibrant colors and some motion, but the vibrancy and motion could be slightly enhanced for full consistency.\n- Lavie: 2, because the video lacks vibrant colors and motion, making it less consistent with the prompt's emphasis on vibrancy.",
    "267": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 3, because the video shows a figure resembling Van Gogh in a room with a painting, but the motion is minimal, and the style is not fully consistent with Van Gogh's work.\n- Pika: 2, because the video focuses on a painting of Van Gogh rather than him painting, and the motion is limited to the hand, not showing Van Gogh in action.\n- Show1: 5, because the video clearly depicts Van Gogh actively painting in a room, with a style consistent with his work, and includes all key elements.\n- Lavie: 3, because the video shows a figure resembling Van Gogh with an easel, but the motion is minimal, and the style is somewhat consistent with Van Gogh's work.",
    "270": "Final Scores:\n- Videocrafter2: 3, because the video includes yellow flowers, but the motion of swinging in the wind is minimal and not very visible. The visual quality is good enough to understand the content.\n- Pika: 2, because while the video shows yellow flowers, there is little to no visible motion indicating swinging. The visual quality is good, but the lack of motion affects consistency with the prompt.\n- Show1: 4, because the video includes yellow flowers with noticeable swinging motion, aligning well with the prompt. The visual quality supports understanding the motion.\n- Lavie: 1, because the video shows yellow flowers but lacks any visible motion or swinging, making it inconsistent with the prompt. The visual quality is clear, but the absence of motion is a significant issue."
