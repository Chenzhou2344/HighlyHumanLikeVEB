      "lavie 0 - A: 4, because the video frames show a close-up of grapes, which is consistent with the text prompt. The grapes are on a rotating table, as evidenced by the slight changes in their positions across the frames. However, the rotation is subtle and not very pronounced, which slightly affects the overall presentation.\n",
      "lavie 3 - A: 2, because the video shows a turtle in the ocean, but the turtle is not swimming. The turtle appears to be stationary on the ocean floor, with no visible movement or swimming action. This significantly deviates from the text prompt, which specifies a turtle swimming in the ocean.\n",
      "lavie 6 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text description. The stormtrooper is clearly seen vacuuming the beach in all frames, accurately depicting the core elements of the prompt. The action of vacuuming is evident, and the beach setting is clear.\n",
      "lavie 9 - A: 2, because while the video does show a panda in the ocean during sunset, the panda is not standing on a surfboard as specified in the prompt. The core element of the panda standing on a surfboard is missing, which significantly deviates from the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 12 - A: 2, because the video shows an astronaut standing on water with a reflection visible, which matches part of the prompt. However, there are no ducks present, and the astronaut is not feeding them. The core elements of feeding ducks and the presence of ducks are missing, making the video almost inconsistent with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 15 - A: 4, because the video frames show two pandas sitting together with an academic paper between them, which aligns with the core elements of the prompt. However, the action of \"discussing\" is not clearly depicted, as the pandas' mouths are open but there is no clear indication of interaction or discussion. The overall presentation is mostly consistent with the text prompt, but the specific action of discussing is not fully clear.\n",
      "lavie 18 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a sunset at the beach with visible changes in the position of the sun and the colors in the sky. The clouds are present and show slight movement, but the motion of the clouds is not very pronounced. The overall presentation closely aligns with the text prompt, but the cloud movement could be more evident.\n",
      "lavie 21 - A: 4, because the video shows a fat rabbit wearing a purple robe walking through a fantasy landscape. The core elements of the prompt are present: the rabbit is fat, wearing a purple robe, and walking. The landscape appears to be fantasy-like with lush greenery and a path. However, the fantasy aspect of the landscape could be more pronounced to perfectly match the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 24 - A: 3, because the video shows a koala bear in a forest setting with a piano, which matches the core elements of the prompt. However, the koala bear is not actively playing the piano in any of the frames, which is a significant part of the action described in the prompt. The koala's position and the piano remain static throughout the frames, indicating a lack of the described action.\n",
      "lavie 27 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. The frames clearly show an astronaut flying in space, with the astronaut's position and orientation changing slightly over time, indicating motion. The background consistently depicts a space environment, fulfilling all core elements of the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 30 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict fireworks, which is the core element of the text prompt. The frames show various stages of fireworks exploding in the sky, with bright colors and patterns that are consistent with the description of \"Fireworks.\" The video perfectly conveys the core information of the text, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 33 - A: 2, because while the video frames depict an animated painting of fluffy white clouds in the sky, there is no noticeable movement of the clouds between the frames. The core element of \"moving\" clouds is missing, making the video almost inconsistent with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 36 - A: 2, because the video frames depict a static scene of a forest with mist, but there is no indication of flying or movement through the landscape. The fantasy element is also not clearly represented, making the video almost inconsistent with the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 39 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a bigfoot walking in a snowstorm. The core elements of the prompt, including the subject (bigfoot), the action (walking), and the setting (snowstorm), are all accurately and consistently presented across the frames. The snowstorm is evident with the falling snow, and the bigfoot is shown in a walking motion in each frame.\n",
      "lavie 42 - A: 3, because the video frames show a squirrel holding what appears to be a burger, but there is no clear action of the squirrel eating the burger. The core elements of a squirrel and a burger are present, but the action described in the prompt (eating) is not clearly depicted.\n",
      "lavie 45 - A: 3, because the video shows a cat wearing sunglasses by a pool, which matches part of the prompt. However, there is no clear indication that the cat is working as a lifeguard. The frames do not show any lifeguard-related actions or props, which are essential elements of the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 48 - A: 3, because the video frames show snow-covered rocky mountains, which aligns with the prompt. However, the deep canyons and their twisting and bending through the high elevated mountain peaks are not clearly visible or emphasized in the frames. The overall presentation partially matches the text description but lacks some core elements.\n",
      "lavie 51 - A: 2, because the video frames show a turquoise liquid, but the action of a \"splash\" is not clearly depicted. The frames show a consistent stream of liquid rather than a splash, and the extreme slow motion effect is not evident. Additionally, there is no indication of an alpha channel being included.\n",
      "lavie 54 - A: 1, because the video does not show the ice cream melting on the table. The ice cream remains in the same state throughout all frames, with no visible melting action occurring. The core element of the prompt, which is the melting action, is completely missing.\n",
      "lavie 57 - A: 3, because the video shows a snowy forest, which is a core element of the prompt. However, there is no clear indication of a drone flying over the forest. The frames appear static, and there is no visible motion or perspective change that would suggest the presence of a drone. The overall presentation partially matches the text prompt but lacks the action of a drone flying.\n",
      "lavie 60 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly show a shark swimming in the ocean, which perfectly matches the text prompt. The shark is visible in all frames, and its movement is consistent with swimming. The core elements of the prompt, including the shark and the ocean, are accurately and clearly presented.\n",
      "lavie 63 - A: 3, because the video frames show an aerial view of a lush, green landscape, which aligns with the concept of a fantasy land. However, the video lacks distinct fantasy elements that would make it more consistent with the \"fantasy land\" aspect of the prompt. The frames do show a panoramic view from a drone, but the fantasy aspect is not clearly depicted.\n",
      "lavie 66 - A: 4, because the video frames show a teddy bear in the ocean, which matches the core elements of the prompt. The teddy bear appears to be in a swimming position in the first two frames, but in the subsequent frames, it seems to be floating rather than actively swimming. The overall presentation is mostly consistent with the text prompt, but the action of swimming is not clearly sustained throughout all frames.\n",
      "lavie 69 - A: 3, because the video frames depict a sunrise, which is consistent with the prompt. However, the frames do not clearly indicate that the scene is on Mars. The landscape and sky color could be interpreted as a generic sunrise on Earth. The core element of \"Mars\" is not distinctly represented, making the overall presentation partially consistent with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 72 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict golden fish swimming in the ocean. The core elements of the prompt, which include the presence of golden fish and their swimming action in an oceanic environment, are accurately and consistently presented across all frames. The fish are visibly moving, and the underwater setting is evident, perfectly matching the text description.\n",
      "lavie 75 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly show an artist's hand holding a brush and painting on a canvas. The close-up view captures the action of painting, with the brush visibly applying paint to the canvas in each frame. This perfectly matches the text prompt \"An artist brush painting on a canvas close up.\"\n",
      "lavie 78 - A: 3, because the video frames show a Christmas tree with lights, which is consistent with the celebration theme. However, there are no visible fireworks or a starry sky in the background, which are core elements mentioned in the prompt. The drone view is implied but not explicitly clear.\n",
      "lavie 81 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. The dog is wearing a yellow turtleneck, appears happy, is facing the camera, and the background is dark. All core elements are accurately and clearly presented, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 84 - A: 4, because the video frames show origami figures in white paper, rendered in 3D, on a white background, and in a studio shot setting. The figures appear to be dancing modern dance, as indicated by their changing poses. However, the movements are somewhat subtle and could be more dynamic to better convey the modern dance aspect.\n",
      "lavie 87 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. It shows a campfire at night in a snowy forest with a starry sky in the background. All core elements are accurately and clearly presented, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 90 - A: 1, because the video frames do not show any significant motion or changes over time. The frames are static and do not convey the dynamic nature of a video. While the landscape depicted is indeed fantasy-like, the lack of motion or action makes it inconsistent with the expectation of a video.\n",
      "lavie 93 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a 3D model of a Victorian house that aligns well with the 1800s style. The house has characteristic architectural features such as a detailed facade, multiple stories, and a porch with columns. However, the video lacks some finer details that could make it perfectly consistent with the prompt. The overall presentation is mostly consistent with the text description.\n",
      "lavie 96 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a person applying makeup, which aligns perfectly with the text prompt \"This is how I do makeup in the morning.\" The actions of using makeup brushes and other tools are consistent with the described activity.\n",
      "lavie 99 - A: 2, because the video shows a raccoon in digital art style, but it does not resemble a turtle in any way. The core element of the raccoon looking like a turtle is missing, making the video almost inconsistent with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 102 - A: 3, because the video frames show a robot in Times Square, which matches the core elements of the prompt. However, the robot does not appear to be dancing. The robot's position remains mostly static across the frames, with no clear indication of dancing movements.\n",
      "lavie 105 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a busy freeway at night. The core elements of the prompt, such as the freeway, the presence of numerous vehicles, and the nighttime setting, are all accurately and clearly presented. The frames show consistent traffic flow, indicating a busy freeway, which aligns perfectly with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 108 - A: 1, because the frames do not show a balloon full of water exploding. The balloon appears to be intact in all frames, and there is no visible explosion or significant change in the water's state. The core action described in the prompt is missing.\n",
      "lavie 111 - A: 1, because the video does not display the core elements mentioned in the text prompt. The astronaut is present, but there is no horse, and the astronaut is not riding anything. The background does suggest space, but the absence of the horse and the riding action makes the video completely inconsistent with the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 114 - A: 3, because the video frames show roasted coffee beans in a bowl, which aligns with the prompt. However, the slow-motion effect is not very clear, and the action of the beans falling into the bowl is not distinctly visible in all frames. The video partially captures the essence of the prompt but lacks clarity in the slow-motion action.\n",
      "lavie 117 - A: 4, because the video frames show an old sewing machine in action, with the needle moving up and down, indicating that it is working. However, the movement is subtle and not very pronounced, which slightly affects the clarity of the action described in the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 120 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly match the text prompt. The frames clearly show colorful ink swirling and dropping in water, creating an abstract and dreamy cloud of ink. The motion and color changes are evident across the frames, fulfilling the description of \"motion color drop in water,\" \"ink swirling in water,\" and \"colorful ink in water.\" The overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 123 - A: 2, because the video shows big purple plums with water drops on their skin, which matches part of the prompt. However, the plums are not rotating on a turntable, and the water drops do not appear during rotation. The background is white, but the lack of rotation and dynamic water drop appearance significantly deviates from the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 126 - A: 3, because the video frames show a girl with vampire makeup, which includes heavy eye makeup and red lips. However, the red contact lenses mentioned in the prompt are not clearly visible. The makeup is consistent with the vampire theme, but the lack of visible red contact lenses means it does not fully meet the prompt's requirements.\n",
      "lavie 129 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly capture the core elements described in the text prompt. The frames show the Pacific coast with the ocean and waves, consistent with the location \"Carmel by the Sea.\" The waves are clearly visible and in motion, aligning well with the prompt's description. The overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 132 - A: 3, because the video shows a teddy bear in Times Square with a drum kit, which matches the core elements of the prompt. However, the teddy bear is not actively playing the drum kit in any of the frames. The bear's arms are positioned as if it might be about to play, but there is no clear action of drumming visible.\n",
      "lavie 135 - A: 4, because the video shows a corgi interacting with a drum kit, and there are drumsticks visible in the frames, suggesting the corgi is playing the drums. However, the action of playing the drum kit is not very clear or explicit in all frames, which slightly reduces the overall consistency with the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 138 - A: 1, because the video frames do not show an iron man playing an electronic guitar. The iron man is present, but there is no guitar or any indication of playing an instrument. The core action described in the prompt is completely missing.\n",
      "lavie 141 - A: 1, because the video frames do not show a raccoon playing an electronic guitar. Instead, the frames depict two raccoons standing together without any musical instrument or action related to playing a guitar. This completely deviates from the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 144 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a boat sailing along the Seine River with the Eiffel Tower in the background, which matches the core elements of the text prompt. The style of the video also resembles Vincent van Gogh's painting style. However, the movement of the boat is minimal and not very clear, which slightly affects the overall consistency.\n",
      "lavie 147 - A: 2, because the video shows a corgi's head, but it does not depict the head as an explosion of a nebula. The background has a slight nebula-like effect in the first frame, but it quickly fades and does not resemble an explosion. The core element of the nebula explosion is almost entirely missing.\n",
      "lavie 150 - A: 1, because the video frames do not show any significant motion or changes over time. The frames are static and do not convey the dynamic nature of a video. While the landscape depicted is indeed fantasy-like, the lack of motion or action makes it inconsistent with the expectation of a video.\n",
      "lavie 153 - A: 2, because the video frames show a digital or holographic representation of a human head, which could be interpreted as futuristic. However, there is no clear indication of teleportation technology or any action related to teleportation. The core element of teleportation is missing, making the video almost inconsistent with the text prompt.\n",
      "lavie 156 - A: 5, because the video frames show a jellyfish floating through the ocean with bioluminescent tentacles. The jellyfish is clearly visible in all frames, and its bioluminescent tentacles are evident, matching the text prompt perfectly. The motion of the jellyfish floating is also consistent across the frames.\n",
      "lavie 159 - A: 2, because while the video does show a mars rover on the surface of Mars, there is no visible movement of the rover across the frames. The prompt specifically mentions the rover moving, but the frames do not depict any significant motion.\n",
      "lavie 162 - A: 4, because the video frames show a panda holding a coffee cup, which aligns with the prompt. The setting appears to be a cafe, and there are elements that suggest it could be in Paris (e.g., the background and ambiance). However, the action of drinking coffee is not clearly depicted in the frames, as the panda is only holding the cup. The overall presentation is mostly consistent with the text prompt, but the specific action of drinking is not fully captured.\n",
      "lavie 165 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a space shuttle launching into orbit, with flames and smoke billowing out from the engines. The core elements of the text prompt, including the space shuttle, the launch action, and the presence of flames and smoke, are all accurately and clearly presented in the video. The sequence of frames shows the shuttle progressively ascending, which aligns perfectly with the description of a launch.\n",
      "lavie 168 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a steam train moving on a mountainside. The train is visible in all frames, and the steam is evident, indicating motion. The mountainside setting is also accurately represented. All core elements from the text prompt are present and consistent throughout the frames.\n",
      "lavie 171 - A: 2, because while the video does feature a giant robot, which is a core element of the prompt, the setting does not clearly convey a cyberpunk Beijing. The background appears to be a generic cityscape without distinct cyberpunk elements or clear indicators of Beijing. Additionally, there is no noticeable action or movement in the frames, making the video almost static.\n",
      "lavie 174 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text description. It shows a tropical beach at sunrise with palm trees and crystal-clear water in the foreground. All core elements are accurately and clearly presented, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "lavie 177 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a figure resembling Van Gogh taking a selfie, and the style is consistent with Van Gogh's painting style. However, the motion is minimal, and the action of taking a selfie is not very dynamic, which slightly affects the overall presentation.\n",
      "lavie 180 - A: 2, because while the video does show Gwen Stacy holding a book, there is no visible action of her reading it. The frames are static, and there is no indication of any movement or engagement with the book, which is a core element of the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 183 - A: 2, because while the video does show Iron Man in the sky, there is no visible motion indicating that he is flying. The frames appear static, with Iron Man maintaining the same position throughout, which does not fully convey the action of flying as described in the prompt.\n",
      "lavie 186 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly match the text prompt \"The bund shanghai, oil painting.\" The frames consistently depict the Bund in Shanghai in the style of an oil painting, with the iconic skyline and buildings clearly visible. The artistic style and subject matter are accurately and clearly presented throughout the frames.\n",
      "lavie 189 - A: 4, because the video frames show Yoda holding and playing a guitar, which matches the core elements of the text prompt. However, the stage setting is not clearly visible, which slightly detracts from the overall consistency.\n",
      "lavie 192 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a coastal beach with waves lapping on the sand, which aligns with the prompt. The style is reminiscent of Hokusai's ukiyo-e art, with the characteristic wave patterns and color palette.

The style of the painting and the setting are consistent with van Gogh's work. However, the action of painting is not very dynamic or clear, as the position of the brush and the man remains almost the same across all frames. This slight lack of motion and clarity in the action prevents it from achieving a perfect score.\n",
      "lavie 274 - A: 2, because while the video does show yellow flowers, there is no visible swinging motion in the wind. The frames appear static, and the action described in the prompt is missing.\n",

However, the action of \"swimming\" is not explicitly clear. The teddy bear seems to be floating rather than actively swimming. Therefore, while the video is mostly consistent with the prompt, the specific action of swimming is not fully depicted.\n",
      "lavie 71 - A: 4, because the video frames depict a sunrise with the sun gradually rising above the horizon, which aligns with the \"time lapse of sunrise\" part of the prompt. The color of the sky and the landscape suggest a Martian environment, but there are no distinct features that definitively indicate Mars.

      "gen2 105 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly match the text prompt \"Busy freeway at night.\" The frames clearly depict a freeway with multiple lanes of traffic, and the light trails indicate a high volume of moving vehicles, which conveys the sense of busyness. The nighttime setting is also accurately represented with the dark sky and illuminated streetlights. All core elements of the prompt are present and clearly depicted.\n",
      "gen2 108 - A: 1, because the video frames do not show the balloon exploding. The balloon remains intact in all frames, and there is no indication of an explosion or water being released.

The photorealistic style is achieved, but the primary action and setting are incorrect.\n",
      "gen2 114 - A: 2, because the video does not fully align with the text prompt. The prompt specifies \"slow motion cropped closeup of roasted coffee beans falling into an empty bowl,\" but the bowl is not empty at the start, and the falling action of the coffee beans is not clearly depicted.

All core elements are accurately and clearly presented, including the beach, waves, and the artistic style. The frames show the motion of the waves, aligning well with the description.\n",
      "videocrafter2 200 - A: 3, because the video frames depict a boat on a river with the Eiffel Tower in the background, which aligns with the core elements of the prompt. However, the boat does not appear to be sailing; it remains stationary in all frames. The artistic style is consistent, but the lack of motion reduces the overall consistency with the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 203 - A: 2, because the video shows a car on a rainy evening, but the street is not empty as there is another car present. Additionally, the car in focus does not appear to be moving slowly; it seems stationary in all frames. The core elements of an empty street and the car moving slowly are not accurately depicted.\n",
      "videocrafter2 206 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. The frames clearly show a cat eating food out of a bowl. The core elements, including the cat, the bowl, and the action of eating, are all accurately and clearly presented. The sequence of frames shows the cat engaging with the food, which aligns perfectly with the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 209 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. The core elements are all present: a cat wearing sunglasses at a pool. The cat is clearly visible with sunglasses on, and the pool setting is evident in the background.

The overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "videocrafter2 218 - A: 3, because the video frames show a cute and happy corgi in a park during sunset, which matches the core elements of the text prompt. However, the corgi is not actively playing; it is mostly in a static or slightly moving position. The action of playing is not clearly depicted, which is a significant part of the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 221 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. It features a cute raccoon playing a guitar in a boat on the ocean. All core elements are present and clearly depicted, including the raccoon, the guitar, the boat, and the ocean setting. The raccoon is consistently shown playing the guitar throughout the frames.\n",
      "videocrafter2 224 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. It shows a happy fuzzy panda playing a guitar near a campfire with snow mountains in the background. All core elements are accurately and clearly presented, and the overall presentation is highly aligned with the text expectations.\n",
      "videocrafter2 227 - A: 4, because the video frames show the Eiffel Tower with lightning striking nearby and dark clouds in the sky, which matches most of the core elements of the prompt. However, the lightning does not appear to be striking directly atop the Eiffel Tower, which is a minor deviation from the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 230 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly match the text prompt. The frames clearly depict a modern art museum with colorful paintings displayed on the walls. The setting and the artwork align well with the description provided in the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 233 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt \"A panda cooking in the kitchen.\" The frames clearly show a panda in a kitchen setting, actively engaged in cooking activities such as handling a pot and adding ingredients. All core elements, including the panda, the kitchen environment, and the cooking action, are accurately and clearly presented.\n",
      "videocrafter2 236 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly show a panda playing on a swing set. The panda is consistently depicted on the swing in all frames, aligning perfectly with the text prompt. The core elements of the prompt, including the panda and the swing set, are accurately and clearly presented.\n",
      "videocrafter2 239 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a polar bear playing a guitar, which matches the text prompt perfectly. The core elements, including the polar bear and the guitar, are accurately and clearly presented, and the action of playing the guitar is evident in all frames.\n",
      "videocrafter2 242 - A: 3, because the video frames show a raccoon dressed in a suit holding a trumpet, which matches the core elements of the text prompt. However, the raccoon is not actively playing the trumpet, and the background is plain rather than a stage. The overall presentation partially aligns with the text expectations but misses some key details.\n",
      "videocrafter2 245 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text prompt. It features a robot DJ playing a turntable on a rooftop in a futuristic, cyberpunk Tokyo setting at night, with heavy rain. The sci-fi and fantasy elements are clearly depicted, and the core elements are accurately and clearly presented.\n",
      "videocrafter2 248 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text description. The shark is clearly visible and swimming in a clear Caribbean ocean, as described in the prompt. The frames show consistent movement of the shark, indicating it is swimming. The water is clear and has the characteristic turquoise color of the Caribbean ocean. All core elements are accurately and clearly presented.\n",
      "videocrafter2 251 - A: 2, because while the video does show a robot in a city, it does not depict the robot actively protecting the city. The robot is stationary in all frames, and there is no visible action or threat that the robot is responding to. The core element of \"protecting\" is missing, making the video almost inconsistent with the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 254 - A: 2, because while the video features teddy bears in a sink, they are not washing dishes. The core action of washing dishes is missing, and the teddy bears appear to be sitting in the sink rather than engaging in the specified activity.\n",
      "videocrafter2 257 - A: 4, because the video frames depict an epic tornado above a glowing city at night, which aligns well with the text prompt. The tornado appears to be made of smoke, and the city below is glowing. However, the tornado's motion and attack are not very clear, and the frames are quite similar, showing minimal progression or action. This slight lack of dynamic action prevents it from achieving a perfect score.\n",
      "videocrafter2 260 - A: 5, because the video perfectly matches the text description. It depicts a couple in formal evening wear holding umbrellas and walking in a heavy downpour. The style of the video is consistent with an oil painting, and all core elements, including the couple, formal wear, umbrellas, and heavy rain, are accurately and clearly presented. The frames show the couple walking, which aligns with the action of going home.\n",
      "videocrafter2 263 - A: 5, because the video frames clearly depict a clown fish swimming through a coral reef. The core elements of the text prompt, including the clown fish, the action of swimming, and the coral reef environment, are all accurately and clearly presented. The frames show the fish in motion, consistent with the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 266 - A: 5, because the video frames show a hyper-realistic spaceship landing on Mars. The spaceship is clearly depicted, and the Martian landscape is accurately represented. The sequence of frames shows the spaceship descending and getting closer to the surface, which aligns perfectly with the prompt.\n",
      "videocrafter2 269 - A: 5, because the video frames perfectly match the text prompt \"The bund shanghai, vibrant color.\" The frames clearly depict the iconic skyline of The Bund in Shanghai with vibrant and colorful lighting, fulfilling both the location and the color vibrancy aspects of the prompt. The consistency is maintained across all frames.\n",
      "videocrafter2 272 - A: 4, because the video frames show a person resembling Vincent van Gogh in a room with a painting in the background, and he appears to be engaged in the act of painting. However, the action of painting is not very dynamic or clear, and the frames are quite similar, showing minimal motion. The core elements are mostly present, but the depiction of the action could be more explicit.\n",
      "videocrafter2 275 - A: 4, because the video frames show yellow flowers, which is consistent with the prompt. The flowers appear to be moving slightly, suggesting they are swinging in the wind. However, the motion is subtle and not very pronounced, which slightly reduces the overall consistency with the prompt.\n"
